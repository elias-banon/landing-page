        <h2> What it is about?</h2>
        <p>This is about fighting against addictions. <br>In fact, some people can't control themselves for some activities like casino, clothes, drugs... <br>Then, with Ecocasino, before going to these activities, you put a limited amount of money. Consequently, your bank account is restricted for charging it again. <br>For instance, we go to the casino with a maximum expense of 50â‚¬ for the night. After playing, you lost everything. With Ecocasino, you have a limited lost because you can't play back. <br>This is a way to help people which are fighting an addiction and to restrict their lost of money. </p>
